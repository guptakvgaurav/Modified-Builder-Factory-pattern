Modified-Builder-Factory-pattern
================================

This is an attempt to modify Builder and Factory pattern. 
Here i tried to take advantage of Builder pattern and merge it with Factory pattern. 
This code attempts to create an instance at runtime and providing a flavor of Builder pattern to the client.
